# Dyad-Epistemics
The Computational Epistemology of Dyadic Formation is a computational philosophy project using Agent-Based Modeling to explore how knowledge and logic shape social dyads. The research investigates the critical impact of information asymmetry and bounded rationality on the fairness and efficiency of dyad formation.
